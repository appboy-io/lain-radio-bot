# **_Lain Radio Bot_**

I'm a big fan of LainChan and love listening to their radio station. So I made a bot that pulls in the audio streams for all radio categories.

## **Add bot to server**

If you're interested in adding this bot to your discord server, click the image below.

## **How to run?**

You'll need a few things to get this up an running. So here are the steps:

- Get a discord or find a discord that doesn't mind you adding a bot.
- Create a bot on Discord's developer site: [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Get your bot's token
- On the system you're developing on, create an environment variable named LainRadioToken and set it to your bot's token.
- Install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Pull down project
- In root of project, run the following commands

```
npm install
npm start
```
